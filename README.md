🛒 Market Basket Analysis

A weekend project to explore Data Analysis & Mining techniques using a grocery transactions dataset.

📌 Overview

This project applies Market Basket Analysis to identify product associations and build a simple recommendation system. We used FP-Growth for frequent itemset mining and association rules to generate insights.

🔧 Features

Data cleaning & preprocessing (normalizing item names, category mapping)

Transaction encoding for basket creation

Frequent pattern mining with FP-Growth

Association rules (support, confidence, lift)

Rule-based recommendation system

Visualizations:

🌞 Sunburst chart – product distribution

🔥 Heatmap – co-occurrence of top items

☁️ Word cloud – most frequent products

📊 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy – data processing

mlxtend – FP-Growth & association rules

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly – visualizations

WordCloud – text visualization

🚀 Next Steps

Build an interactive frontend (Streamlit) where users can:

Add items to a cart

Get recommendations in real-time

Explore visual dashboards
